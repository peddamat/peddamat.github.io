# Notes

This is my personal fork of the excellent [mr-karan/notes](https://github.com/mr-karan/notes) repo.

## Local Setup

To preview the site locally:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
make run
```

## Workflow

Notes are written in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) with a bunch of extensions and plugins to publish them at [samrambles.com](https://samrambles.com).
